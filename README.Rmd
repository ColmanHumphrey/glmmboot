# glmmboot

The goal of glmmboot is to provide a simple method to create
bootstrap confidence intervals using a wide set of models. For 
models with random effects, the default behaviour will 
be to block sample over the effect with the largest entropy 
(generally the one with the most levels); with no random effects,
performs case resampling. 

The only requirements are that the model works with the 
function update, to change the data; and that the coefficients
are extractable using coef(summary(model)) or coef(summary(model))$cond.
The data will be automatically extracted if of typical form; if not, you can 
supply it manually. 

## Installation

For now, you can install glmmboot from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ColmanHumphrey/glmmboot")
```

## Example

We'll provide a quick example using glm. First we'll set up some data:

```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(50)
x2 <- runif(50)

expit <- function(x){exp(x) / (1 + exp(x))}

y_mean <- expit(0.2 - 0.3 * x1 + 0.4 * x2)

y <- rbinom(50, 1, prob = y_mean)
```

Typically this model is fit with logistic regression:

```{r}
base_run <- glm(y ~ x1 + x2, family = binomial(link = 'logit'))

summary(base_run)
```

Let's run a bootstrap. We'll set `num_cores = 1` because the model
is small - parallel overhead is too expensive here.

```{r}
library(glmmboot)
boot_results <- BootGlmm(base_model = base_run, resamples = 999, num_cores = 1)
```

And the results:
```{r}
print(boot_results)
```

The estimates are the same, since we just pull from the base model. The intervals are 
similar to the base model, although slightly narrower: typical logistic regression is fractionally
conservative at `N = 50`.
