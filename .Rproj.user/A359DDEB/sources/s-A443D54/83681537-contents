Title: Bootstrap Resampling for Mixed Effects Models
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Colman", "Humphrey", email = "humphrc@tcd.ie",

Description: Small package that performs bootstrap resampling for mixed effects
    models, and more generally nearly all models that 'update' works for. There
    are two main functions: BootGlmm performs block resampling if random effects
    are present, and case resampling if not; BootCI converts output from
    bootstrap model runs into confidence intervals and p-values. By default,
    BootGlmm calls BootCI.
