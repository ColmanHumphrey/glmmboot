## Release Summary

Primary purpose of this change is to add conditional eval statements for tests
and vignettes using `glmmTMB`. The other change was fully removing functions
deprecated as of 0.4.0, hence the minor version bump.

* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.6.2
* win-builder, devel R 4.0.0 alpha, and release R 3.6.3
