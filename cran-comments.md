## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Added '()' to all functions in the description.
* Added a reference to our paper on arxiv
* As per email to Swetlana, did not change \dontrun{} to \donttest{}: the examples in \dontrun{} take longer than 5 seconds to run, more like a few minutes.
* Added message output in BootGlmm() (not requested by CRAN / Swetlana)


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

* This is my first CRAN submission, likely causing the note.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
